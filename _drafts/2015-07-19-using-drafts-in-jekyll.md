Keeping drafts in Jekyll is easy. Add your WIPs to this `_drafts` folder and run `jekyll serve --drafts` to generate and serve your site with your drafts visible like normal posts. 

If you're looking to deploy *without* drafts, run a normal `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` and the drafts will stay hidden.
