# Nominal
### A minimal Jekyll theme. Your blank slate.
Nominal is a fast, flexible theme built for blogging. It includes a basic way to show off your work, and a strong typographical layout to share your thoughts.

## Setup
1. Copy this repo into a folder on your drive.
 1. Create a folder where you want to keep your site. You can use Finder to do this.
 2. Open terminal. Type `cd`, add a space, *then drag your site folder into the terminal window*. It should look something like: `cd /path/to/your/folder`. Hit enter. You should not be in your site folder (which is empty).
 3. Copy and paste the following to copy the contents of this repo into your site folder: `git clone git@github.com:estrattonbailey/Nominal.git .` (include the period at the end). If you don't want to do this, just download the ZIP package from the homepage of this project and unpack it inside your site folder using Finder.
2. Install the Jekyll ruby gem<br/>`$ gem install jekyll`.
3. Back in terminal, type `jekyll serve` and hit enter to build your site. This command also starts a server for you to view your site. Type `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to see it running.

## Customize
Edit a few basic copy, color, and meta information settings in the _config.yml file in the root directory. **Important:** before you deploy your own site, you'll need to change the URL setting from `localhost` to whatever your domain name is.
